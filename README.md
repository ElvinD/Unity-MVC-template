# Unity MVC template

Warning: I have not updated this repo in a while, so guarantee not included it will still compile...
What this does is implement the MVC paradigm into the Unity ecosystem. Unity is very IDE oriented so the abstraction of code and buttons did not work very well at the time I made this, but it was fun to do.
